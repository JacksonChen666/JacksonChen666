<details><summary>Why did you make your activity private?</summary>

Because frankly, who cares? If you're here to write code, looking at
profiles for maybe some dopamine hits (or self-comparison and realizing
you're inferior in amounts of activity to [some random human who uses
computer and internet][nekopsykose]) is not going to achieve any code
writing. The code doesn't write itself, it has to be written (even with AI,
which [has it's own issues][aiissue]).
