# Hi, I'm Jackson

I'm a person who has interest in programming with other related things. It's great to see that there are people that are also curious about programming, but I'm not a expert really.

Here's some things about me:

- I program in Python 3, and Java

- I've learnt other languages on my own like Java, JS, HTML, etc.

- I can get fustrated easily if you don't understand, but that's not your problem.

That is all for this profile. If you think there's any ideas I can do, you may suggest it to me.
